# KeyCode

A Framework for ease of use in creating presentations using SwiftUI.

## How To Use

First, include this package. Best, you start with a theme (ToDo).

When your project is set up, you can navigate the presentation as such:

* **→ right arrow** | next slide / step
* **← left arrow** | previous slide / step

Hold one of the following modifiers for animation modification:

* **⌥ option** | animate slowly
* **⌘ command** | animate even more slowly

Note that as opposed to normal presentation programs, you can easily skip through your presentation holding left or right. SwiftUI is pretty good at state interpolation.

## Project Structure

This package contains two categories of classes: Those necessary for holding any presentation, and some utility functions common in many presentations. I recommend looking through a template to get an idea, as currently, no great documentation exists. I may follow up on this.
